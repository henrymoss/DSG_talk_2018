# DSG_talk_2018
Talk (and code) from my talk @ Lancaster Data Science Group on "Parameter tuning off the grid"

I have included a python notebook that provides implementations of grid-search, random-search and Bayesian Optimization on a simple IMDB movie review classification task.

To learn more about using BO for tuning machine learning model I reccomend the following tutorials:

Sklearn provide clear introductions to grid and random search:
